Visual Inspection
The technician checks the tyres for visible damage, such as cuts, punctures, or cracks, which can compromise safety and performance.

2. Tread Depth Check
The tyre tread depth is measured to ensure it meets safety standards. Worn treads reduce traction, especially in wet conditions, and tyres may need to be replaced if the tread is too low.

3. Tyre Pressure Check and Adjustment
Tyre pressure is measured and adjusted as per the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations. Proper tyre pressure improves fuel efficiency, handling, and overall safety.

4. Tyre Rotation
Tyres are rotated (moving the front tyres to the rear and vice versa) to ensure even wear across all tyres, extending their lifespan and improving balance.

5. Wheel Balancing
Wheels are balanced to avoid vibrations when driving. Small weights are added to balance any uneven distribution, which enhances ride comfort and reduces wear on suspension components.

6. Wheel Alignment
If needed, a wheel alignment is performed to ensure the tyres are aligned properly with the steering and suspension. Misalignment can cause uneven tyre wear and affect handling.

7. Cleaning
Tyres and rims are cleaned to remove dirt and debris. Proper cleaning helps in maintaining the rubber quality and preventing corrosion on rims.

8. Final Inspection and Test Drive
After all steps are completed, a final check is done, and a test drive may be conducted to ensure smooth driving and correct any remaining issues.

Regular tyre servicing ensures better handling, longer tyre life, improved fuel efficiency, and overall vehicle safety.
