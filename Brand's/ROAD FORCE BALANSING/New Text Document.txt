Mounting the Wheel and Tire Assembly
The wheel and tire are mounted on a specialized road force balancing machine, which applies pressure to the tire using a roller to simulate the force of the road against it.

Simulating Road Conditions
The machine spins the wheel and presses the roller against the tire to mimic real-world driving conditions. This helps detect variations in stiffness across the tire surface, which can cause vibrations that normal balancing might miss.

Measuring Force Variation
The machine measures “road force,” or variations in pressure that the tire exerts as it rotates under load. These variations can result from tire or wheel imperfections, like a slightly uneven tire surface or a wheel that is not perfectly round.

Identifying Optimal Placement
Based on the measurements, the machine suggests adjustments, such as rotating the tire on the wheel to match high and low spots (known as "match mounting") to reduce vibration.

Adding or Adjusting Weights
After the tire is optimally positioned on the wheel, the technician may add small balancing weights to fine-tune the balance further.

Final Testing
Once adjustments are complete, the machine retests to ensure that the road force is within acceptable limits and that the tire assembly is balanced for a smooth ride.
