Assessment and Inspection
The technician first inspects the tires and suspension system. Signs that alignment may be needed include uneven tire wear, the vehicle pulling to one side, or a misaligned steering wheel.

Positioning the Vehicle on the Alignment Machine
The vehicle is placed on a specialized alignment machine equipped with sensors and cameras to measure the tire angles precisely.

Measuring Angles
The machine measures the three main angles of the tires: camber, which is the tilt of the tire inward or outward; caster, which is the angle of the steering axis; and toe, which is the angle at which the tires point toward or away from each other.

Adjusting the Angles
Using the alignment machine, the technician adjusts the tires to the correct angles so that the vehicle drives straight and true.

Testing and Verification::
The technician may test drive the vehicle to confirm the alignment is correct and that the car drives in a straight line without pulling to one side.

Final Check
After alignment is complete, the vehicle undergoes a final inspection to ensure everything is properly adjusted.
