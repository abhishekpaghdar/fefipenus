Inspection and Evaluation
The technician inspects the brake pads, rotors, calipers, and brake lines for any signs of wear, cracks, rust, or damage. Checking for uneven wear or damage is crucial for identifying when service is needed.

Replacing Brake Pads
If the brake pads are worn down, they are replaced with new ones. Brake pads help the vehicle slow down and stop by applying friction to the wheels, and replacing them ensures smooth, safe braking.

Repairing or Replacing Rotors and Drums
The rotors and drums are checked for wear. If they are excessively worn or damaged, they may need to be resurfaced or replaced to maintain proper braking performance.

Inspecting and Refilling Brake Fluid
The brake fluid level is checked, as well as its condition. If the fluid is low or has deteriorated, it is replaced. Fresh brake fluid helps maintain proper hydraulic pressure in the brake system for effective braking.

Inspecting Brake Lines
The brake lines and hoses are checked for cracks, leaks, or wear. Any damage to the brake lines is repaired or replaced to prevent fluid loss or pressure failure.

Checking Other Components
Other parts of the brake system, such as the brake calipers and master cylinder, are inspected to ensure they are functioning correctly and do not have any issues.

Test Drive and Confirmation
After all repairs and replacements, the technician performs a test drive to ensure that the brakes are functioning properly, and the braking feels smooth and effective.
