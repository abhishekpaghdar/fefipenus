Inspection of the Exhaust System
The technician begins by examining the entire exhaust system, checking for rust, cracks, holes, or any signs of leaks in the exhaust pipes, muffler, catalytic converter, and joints.

Exhaust Leak Detection
Using specialized tools, the technician tests for exhaust leaks that may cause fumes to escape into the cabin or affect engine performance. Leaks are often located in hard-to-reach spots, so careful inspection is essential.

Testing Emissions Levels
An emissions test may be conducted to ensure that the exhaust system is within environmental safety standards. This can help determine if the catalytic converter or oxygen sensors need replacement.

Cleaning or Replacing the Catalytic Converter
If the catalytic converter is clogged or damaged, it may need cleaning or replacement. This component is crucial for reducing harmful emissions.

Checking and Replacing Mufflers and Resonators
Mufflers and resonators reduce noise from the exhaust system. If these parts are damaged or corroded, they may need to be replaced to restore optimal sound levels and performance.

Inspecting the Exhaust Manifold
The technician checks the exhaust manifold, which collects exhaust gases from the engineâ€™s cylinders. Cracks or leaks in this component can impact vehicle performance and fuel efficiency.

Replacing Gaskets and Seals
Gaskets and seals in the exhaust system are checked and, if worn, replaced to prevent exhaust leaks and maintain pressure within the system.

Final Testing and Verification
After all repairs and replacements, the technician conducts a final check to ensure the exhaust system is functioning properly and that there are no leaks or unusual sounds.
