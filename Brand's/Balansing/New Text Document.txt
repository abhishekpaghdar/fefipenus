Preparation and Inspection
The technician removes the wheels from the vehicle and inspects the tires and rims for any visible damage or uneven wear that could affect balance.

Mounting the Wheel
Each wheel is mounted onto a wheel balancing machine, which spins it to measure imbalance. The machine simulates the wheel’s rotation at high speeds to detect any irregular weight distribution.

Identifying Imbalance
As the wheel spins, sensors on the balancing machine identify where weight imbalances occur. These are typically noted in ounces or grams, pinpointing specific spots on the wheel.

Adding Weights
Based on the machine’s readings, the technician attaches small metal weights to the rim at precise locations to counterbalance the heavy spots. These weights may be clipped or adhered, depending on the wheel type.

Testing and Verification
The technician rechecks the wheel on the machine to ensure it’s now balanced. If needed, they make small adjustments until the machine confirms a balanced spin.

Reinstallation
The balanced wheels are then reinstalled on the vehicle. This process reduces vibrations, enhances handling, and promotes even tire wear for a smoother, safer ride.
