Visual Inspection
The technician starts by visually inspecting the entire suspension system, including the shocks, struts, springs, control arms, bushings, and ball joints. They check for any visible signs of damage, wear, or leaks, such as worn bushings or leaking shock absorbers.

Testing for Unusual Noises
During a test drive or while checking the suspension components, the technician listens for any unusual noises, such as clunking, squeaking, or rattling sounds. These noises often indicate worn or damaged suspension parts.

Checking Shock Absorbers and Struts
The technician tests the shock absorbers and struts for proper functioning. If they are leaking fluid or have lost their damping ability, they may need to be replaced. Worn shocks or struts can lead to poor ride quality and handling.

Inspecting Springs
The springs (coil or leaf springs) are checked for any signs of sagging, broken coils, or damage. Worn springs can cause uneven ride height or affect handling and stability.

Examining Control Arms, Ball Joints, and Bushings
The control arms and ball joints are checked for any play or wear that can affect alignment or steering. Worn bushings can cause poor handling, vibrations, and excessive tire wear. If any components are worn, they are replaced.

Checking Alignment and Steering Linkage
The technician inspects the steering system and alignment. Misalignment or issues with steering components like tie rods can affect the vehicle's handling and safety. The technician may recommend an alignment service if necessary.

Tire Inspection
The suspension system is often connected to tire performance, so the technician checks the tires for uneven wear that might indicate suspension issues. Uneven tire wear could suggest problems with alignment, shocks, or springs.

Test Drive and Final Assessment
After repairs or replacements, a test drive is conducted to assess the suspension's performance, handling, and ride comfort. The technician ensures that the vehicle is driving smoothly and that no further suspension issues remain.
