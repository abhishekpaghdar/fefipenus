                    <p><b style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Minor Sidewall Damage:</b><br>
                        <b>Process:</b> For minor scuffs or punctures on the sidewall, a temporary
                        repair may be done by
                        reinforcing the damaged area using specialized patching materials. However, this is typically a
                        short-term solution.<br>
                        <b>Recommendation:</b> Minor damage can sometimes be repaired if it doesn’t
                        compromise the strength of
                        the tyre. It is essential to have a professional assess the damage.<br><br>

                        <b style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">Long-Term Safety:</b><br>
                        <b>Caution:</b> Sidewall damage may compromise the strength of the tyre, even
                        if it seems repaired.
                        Always consult with a professional to ensure the repair is done correctly, or consider replacing
                        the tyre if the damage is severe enough.

                    <h3>Air Leak Repairs</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Inspection:</b>
                        The first step in air leak repairs is to inspect the tyre thoroughly. The tyre is often
                        submerged in water to identify the location of the leak by looking for air bubbles.<br><br>

                        <b>Sealing the Leak:</b>
                        Once the leak is identified, the damaged area is sealed using a tire sealant or by replacing the
                        faulty valve stem or damaged bead.<br><br>

                        <b>Replacing Damaged Parts:</b>
                        In some cases, parts like valve stems or bead areas may need to be replaced entirely. After
                        sealing the leak, the tyre is checked to ensure that it holds air properly.<br><br>

                        <b>Final Check:</b>
                        After the repair, the tyre is inflated to the recommended pressure, and a final inspection is
                        performed to ensure no further leaks are present.

                    <p>
                        <b>Inspection:</b> The tyre is first removed from the rim, and the bead area is carefully
                        inspected for
                        damage.<br><br>
                        <b>Cleaning:</b> The rim and bead area are cleaned to ensure a proper seal.<br><br>
                        <b>Repairing the Bead:</b> If the bead area is damaged or has a poor seal, it is carefully
                        repaired or
                        resealed using specialized tools or rubber adhesives.<br><br>
                        <b>Reinstallation:</b> After the bead is repaired, the tyre is re-mounted on the rim, and the
                        inflation
                        process is completed.

                    <h3>Curb Damage and Scratches</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Inspection:</b> The first step is to thoroughly inspect the damage to assess the extent of
                        the
                        scratches or curb impact. Minor scratches may only require cosmetic touch-ups, while deeper
                        gouges or significant curb damage will need more intensive repair.<br><br>
                        <b>Sanding:</b> A sanding tool is used to smooth the surface and remove any rough edges. This
                        step
                        prepares the wheel for filler application.<br><br>
                        <b>Filler Application:</b> For deeper scratches or dents, a specialized filler is applied to the
                        damaged area to restore the wheel’s smooth surface. Once applied, the filler is allowed to cure
                        and harden.<br><br>
                        <b>Smoothing and Polishing:</b> After the filler has set, the area is sanded down again to match
                        the
                        original texture of the wheel. A polishing compound is used to give the wheel a smooth and shiny
                        finish.

                    <h3>Bent Rim Repair</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Initial Inspection:</b>
                        The first step is to inspect the wheel for any visible cracks or severe bends. If the bend is
                        too severe, the wheel may need to be replaced. Minor bends, however, can be repaired
                        effectively.<br><br>

                        <b>Wheel Heating:</b>
                        The alloy wheel is heated using specialized equipment to soften the metal. This allows the
                        material to become more malleable, which makes it easier to reshape.<br><br>

                        <b>Straightening Process:</b>
                        Once the wheel is sufficiently heated, it’s placed on a hydraulic press or specialized machine
                        that gently reshapes the rim back to its original form. This process helps restore the
                        structural integrity of the wheel and prevents further damage.<br><br>

                        <b>Cooling and Finishing:</b>
                        After straightening, the wheel is allowed to cool. Once cooled, the technician will check the
                        wheel for any imperfections and ensure that it’s structurally sound.

                    <h3>Crack Repair</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Preparation:</b>
                        Once the crack is identified, the damaged area is cleaned to remove any dirt, debris, or rust.
                        This ensures that the repair process is effective and the materials bond properly to the
                        wheel.<br><br>

                        <b>Shaping and Grinding:</b>
                        After welding, the repaired area is ground down and shaped to match the original contours of the
                        wheel. This ensures that the wheel remains balanced and aesthetically consistent.<br><br>

                        <b>Polishing and Finishing:</b>
                        To give the repaired area a smooth, seamless look, it is polished to match the rest of the
                        wheel. Any visible imperfections are addressed to ensure the wheel looks as good as new.<br><br>

                        <b>Testing and Quality Check:</b>
                        After repair, the wheel is carefully inspected again for any remaining flaws. It is also tested
                        for strength to ensure it can withstand normal driving conditions. In some cases, the repaired
                        wheel may undergo a pressure test to verify its structural integrity.

                    <h3>Refinishing and Repainting</h3>
                    <p>
                        First, the wheel is stripped of its old paint, which may
                        have become chipped, faded, or damaged over time. This step ensures that any imperfections or
                        corrosion are removed, providing a clean surface for the new finish.<br><br>

                        After cleaning, a layer of primer is applied to improve paint adhesion and protect the wheel
                        from future damage. The wheel is then coated with high-quality paint, often in a color that
                        matches the original or a custom finish.<br><br>

                        Once the wheel has been painted, it is carefully polished to achieve a smooth and shiny surface.
                        The result is a wheel that looks like new, with a durable finish that resists corrosion, wear,
                        and tear. Refinishing and repainting can help restore the appearance of wheels that have become
                        dull or damaged, providing a cost-effective alternative to replacing the entire wheel.</p>

                    <h3>Polishing and Cleaning</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Cleaning:</b><br>
                        Use a specialized wheel cleaner to remove brake dust, dirt, and grime.<br>
                        A soft brush or microfiber cloth is used to scrub the surface without damaging the finish.<br>
                        Rinse thoroughly to remove all residue.<br><br>

                        <b>Polishing:</b><br>
                        After cleaning, a high-quality polish is applied to restore the wheel's shine.<br>
                        Use a soft cloth or polishing machine to buff the surface to a smooth, glossy finish.<br>
                        This step helps remove minor scratches and oxidation, giving the wheel a like-new
                        appearance.<br><br>

                        <b>Benefits:</b><br>
                        Restores the shine of the alloy wheel, making it look as good as new.<br>
                        Prevents corrosion and oxidation by keeping the wheel surface clean and smooth.<br>
                        Increases the lifespan of the alloy wheel by protecting it from harmful build-up.<br>
                        Improves the overall aesthetic of the vehicle, contributing to its value and appeal.
